# MisakaX iOS 18.1 - iOS 17 Jailbreak Tweak Customization Tool
How to install MisakaX iOS 17 - iOS 18 iDevice Customization tool that was developed by @34306 and @straight-tamago based on Nugget command line tool use of SparseRestore exploit. 

This tutorial will cover installing the MisakaX iOS 17 - iOS 18 iDevice Customization tool, which was developed by @34306 and @straight-tamago. It is based on the Nugget command-line tool and uses the SparseRestore exploit.

This no-jailbreak need tool was the only tool currently supported for iOS and iPad users on iOS 18 and iOS 17 versions, it can be used for the iDevice Customization if Jailbreak does not support your device.

To install the MisakaX tool, users need a Windows or Mac. The package is released as a DMG file and an EXE for Windows users. The installation process is straightforward; if you do not have a PC, you can't install this tool yet. But soon, if we get the Jailbreak for iOS 17 - iOS 18, we hope the developers release this as an iPA package or repo via Sileo or Cydia.

The TrollRestore tool uses the SparseRestore exploit to install TrollStore on iOS 17 and iPadOS. This Troll MisakaX, uses the same exploit. So, if you are looking for a Jailbreak-like experience without jailbreaking your iPhone 16 and below, this is the tool you are looking for.

MisakaX is not an illegal iPhone application because Apple hides most features from the current iOS version for future marketing purposes. The MisakaX tool will unlock those existing hidden features and give users early access. With the help of these features, you don't need to buy new iPhones or update your device.
